## Working with RESTful APIs
============================

# REST (Representational State Transfer)
- Is an architectural style for designing networked applications, particularly
  web-based systems.
- It relies on stateless, client-server communication, typically over HTTP,
  using standard methods like GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.
- REST relies on sockets to send and receive data over the internet. For
  example, when you use a web browser to visit a website or an app to fetch
  data from an API, sockets are the underlying mechanism enabling that
  communication.

# A breakdown of REST:
  1. Representational:
    - Data or states are represented as plain text (often JSON or XML)
    - Then they are sent/received over the network.
    - It doesn't transfer objects but their representations.

  2. State:
    - Refers to the current condition of a resource (e.g., a user profile or
      product data) stored on a server.

  3. Transfer:
    - The network (usually the internet) acts as a carrier to send these
     representations or state-changing actions between client and server.

----------------
**Key Idea**
----------------
- REST enables interaction with server-hosted resources by transferring
  their state representations via standardized protocals, without direct
  method calls.
- It's foundational for APIs and web services, ensuring scalability and
  simplicity.

## What Are BSD Sockets?
=========================

** Imagine you want to send a letter to a friend in another city. You need a
   mailbox (an endpoint) to send it from and another mailbox for your friend
   to receive it.
   In the world of of computers, BSD sockets are like these mailboxes for
   programs.
   They are not physical; They are software interfaces that let programs send
   and receive data over a network, like the Internet, or even within the same
   computer.
**

- BSD sockets originated in 1983 at the University of California, Berkeley.
- They are a standardized interface for network communication, adopted by
  POSIX as POSIX sockets.
- They act as endpoints for sending and receiving data over a network, like
  the internet, allowing programs (e.g., in Python) to exchange messages
  with remote systems.
- Based on the Unix philosophy of "everything is a file,"sockets function like
  files:
	- writing to a socket sends data.
	- reading from it retrives data.
- Sockets form the foundation for network programming, including REST-based
  systems.
 
## Socket Domains: Where Communication Happens
===============================================

- Sockets operate in different domains, which define the scope of communication.
- Think of domains as different neighborhoods where your mailboxes (sockets)
  can be located:
    1. Unix Domain:
      - Used for communication between programs running on the same computer.
      
      **
        Imagine two people in the same house passing notes through an internal
        mail slot. They don't need to go outside (to a network) to
	communicate.
      **
   
    - A database and a web server on the same machine might use Unix domain
      socket to talk to each other quickly and securely, without involving
      the network.
    - It's faster than networkcommunication since it stays within the
      operating system.

  2. Internet Domain (INET):
    - Used for communication between programs on different computers (or the
      same computer) over a TCP/IP network, like the internet.
      
      **
	This is like sending a letter to someone in another city via the
        postal service.
        The letter travels over the internet to reach its destination.
      **

   - Most Internet-based applications, like web browsers, email clients, or
     REST APIs use INET sockets to communicate across systems.


## Socket Address: Finding the Right Mailbox
=============================================
- For two programs to communicate via sockets, they need to know exactly where
  to send and receive data. This is where a socket address comes in.
- In the INET domain, a socket address is like a full postal address, made
  up of two parts:
    1. IP Address:
      - A unique identifier for a computer (or device) on a TCP/IP network,
        like the internet.
      - IPv4 Format: Is a 32-bit number written as four numbers (0-255) separated
        by dots, e.g., 192.168.1.1 or 87.98.239.87. Each number represents
        8 bits (a byte).
      - IPv6 Note: There's a newer standard(IPv6) with 128-bit addresses
        (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334), but it's less common.

      **
        Think of the IP address as the street address of a house. It tells you
        which computer to send data to.
        When you visit google.com, your computer resolves it to an IP address
        like 142.250.190.78 to locate Google's server.
      **

    2. Port Number (Service Number):
      - A 16-bit number (0 to 65,535) that identifies a specific socket on a computer.
      
      **
        If the IP address is the streer address, the port number is the specific
        appartment number in a building. It tells you which program (e.g., a web
        server or email server) to deliver the data to.
      **

      - Many services use well-known port numbers, e.g., HTTP (used by REST)
        typically uses port 80, HTTPS uses port 443 and email (SMTP) uses port 25.
      - A web server might be at 192.168.1.1:80 where 80 is the port for
        HTTP traffic.
